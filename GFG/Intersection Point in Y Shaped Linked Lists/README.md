Given two singly linked lists, return the point where two linked lists intersect.

Note: If the linked lists do not merge at any point, return -1.

Examples:

Input: Linked list 1: 4->4->4->4->4, Linked list 2: 4->4->4
 
Output: 4

Explanation: From the above image, it is clearly seen that the common part is 4->4 whose starting point is 4.

Input: Linked list 1: 4->1->8->4->5, Linked List 2: 5->6->1->8->4->5
 
Output: 8

Explanation: From the above image, it is clearly seen that the common part is 8->4->5 whose starting point is 8.

Input: Linked list 1: 1->2->3, Linked list 2: 4->5->6

Output: -1

Explanation: There is no common part, so there is no interaction point.

Try to solve the problem without using any extra space.


Constraints:

2 ≤ size of first linkedist + size of second linkedlist ≤ 2*10^5

-1000 ≤ data of nodes ≤ 1000
