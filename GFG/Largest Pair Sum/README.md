#  Easy

Find the largest pair sum in an array of distinct integers.

Examples :

Input: arr[] = [12, 34, 10, 6, 40]

Output: 74

Explanation: Sum of 34 and 40 is the largest, i.e, 34 + 40 = 74.

Input: arr[] = [10, 20, 30]

Output: 50

Explanation: 20 + 30 = 50.


Expected Time Complexity: O(n)

Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

Constraints:

2 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 10^6

0 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10^6
