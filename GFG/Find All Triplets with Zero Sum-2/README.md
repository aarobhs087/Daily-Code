Given an array arr[], find all possible triplets i, j, k in the arr[] whose sum of elements is equals to zero. 

Returned triplet should also be internally sorted i.e. i<j<k.

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [0, -1, 2, -3, 1]

Output: [[0, 1, 4], [2, 3, 4]]

Explanation: Triplets with sum 0 are:

arr[0] + arr[1] + arr[4] = 0 + (-1) + 1 = 0

arr[2] + arr[3] + arr[4] = 2 + (-3) + 1 = 0

Input: arr[] = [1, -2, 1, 0, 5]

Output: [[0, 1, 2]]

Explanation: Only triplet which satisfies the condition is arr[0] + arr[1] + arr[2] = 1 + (-2) + 1 = 0

Input: arr[] = [2, 3, 1, 0, 5]

Output: [[]]

Explanation: There is no triplet with sum 0.


Constraints:

3 <= arr.size() <= 10^3

-10^4 <= arr[i] <= 10^4
