Given an array arr[] of n sorted linked lists of different sizes. The task is to merge them in such a way that after merging they will be a single sorted linked list, then return the head of the merged linked list.

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [1 -> 2 -> 3, 4 -> 5, 5 -> 6, 7 -> 8]

Output: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7 -> 8

Explanation:

The arr[] has 4 sorted linked list of size 3, 2, 2, 2.

1st list: 1 -> 2-> 3

2nd list: 4 -> 5

3rd list: 5 -> 6

4th list: 7 -> 8

The merged list will be:
 
Input: arr[] = [1 -> 3, 8, 4 -> 5 -> 6]

Output: 1 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 8

Explanation:

The arr[] has 3 sorted linked list of size 2, 3, 1.

1st list: 1 -> 3

2nd list: 8

3rd list: 4 -> 5 -> 6

The merged list will be:


Constraints
