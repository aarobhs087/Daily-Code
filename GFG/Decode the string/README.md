Given an encoded string s, the task is to decode it. The encoding rule is :

k[encodedString], where the encodedString inside the square brackets is being repeated exactly k times. Note that k is guaranteed to be a positive integer.

Note: The test cases are generated so that the length of the output string will never exceed 105 .

Examples:

Input: s = "1[b]"

Output: "b"

Explanation: "b" is present only one time.

Input: s = "3[b2[ca]]"

Output: "bcacabcacabcaca"

Explanation:

1. Inner substring “2[ca]” breakdown into “caca”.

2. Now, new string becomes “3[bcaca]”

3. Similarly “3[bcaca]” becomes “bcacabcacabcaca ” which is final result.


Constraints:

1 ≤ |s| ≤ 10^5
