Given a binary tree, the task is to find the maximum path sum. The path may start and end at any node in the tree.

Examples:

Input: root[] = [10, 2, 10, 20, 1, N, -25, N, N, N, N, 3, 4]

Output: 42

Explanation: 

Max path sum is represented using green colour nodes in the above binary tree.

Input: root[] = [-17, 11, 4, 20, -2, 10]

Output: 31

Explanation: 

Max path sum is represented using green colour nodes in the above binary tree.


Constraints:

1 ≤ number of nodes ≤ 10^3

-10^4 ≤ node->data ≤ 10^4
