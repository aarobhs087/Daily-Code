# Easy

Given an array arr of 0s and 1s. Find and return the length of the longest subarray with equal number of 0s and 1s.

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0]

Output: 6

Explanation: arr[1...6] is the longest subarray with three 0s and three 1s.

Input: arr[] = [0, 0, 1, 1, 0]

Output: 4

Explnation: arr[0...3] or arr[1...4] is the longest subarray with two 0s and two 1s.

Input: arr[] = [0]

Output: 0

Explnation: There is no subarray with an equal number of 0s and 1s.


Constraints:

1 <= arr.size() <= 10^5

0 <= arr[i] <= 1
