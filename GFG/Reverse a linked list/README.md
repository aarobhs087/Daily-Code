Given the head of a linked list, the task is to reverse this list and return the reversed head.

Examples:

Input: head: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> NULL

Output: head: 4 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1 -> NULL


Input: head: 2 -> 7 -> 10 -> 9 -> 8 -> NULL

Output: head: 8 -> 9 -> 10 -> 7 -> 2 -> NULL


Input: head: 10 -> NULL

Output: 10 -> NULL


Constraints:

1 <= number of nodes, data of nodes <= 10^5
