Given an unsorted array of integers, find the number of continuous subarrays having sum exactly equal to a given number k.

Examples:

Input: arr = [10, 2, -2, -20, 10], k = -10

Output: 3

Explaination: Subarrays: arr[0...3], arr[1...4], arr[3...4] have sum exactly equal to -10.

Input: arr = [9, 4, 20, 3, 10, 5], k = 33

Output: 2

Explaination: Subarrays: arr[0...2], arr[2...4] have sum exactly equal to 33.

Input: arr = [1, 3, 5], k = 0

Output: 0

Explaination: No subarray with 0 sum.


Constraints:


1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 10^5

-10^3 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10^3

-10^7 ≤ k ≤ 10^7
