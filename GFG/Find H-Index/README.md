Given an integer array citations[], where citations[i] is the number of citations a researcher received for the ith paper. The task is to find the H-index.

H-Index is the largest value such that the researcher has at least H papers that have been cited at least H times.

Examples:

Input: citations[] = [3, 0, 5, 3, 0]

Output: 3

Explanation: There are at least 3 papers (3, 5, 3) with at least 3 citations.

Input: citations[] = [5, 1, 2, 4, 1]

Output: 2

Explanation: There are atleast 2 papers (5, 2, 4) with atleast 2 citations.

Input: citations[] = [0, 0]

Output: 0


Constraints:

1 ≤ citations.size() ≤ 10^6

0 ≤ citations[i] ≤ 10^6
