Given an integer array arr[]. Find the contiguous sub-array(containing at least one number) that has the maximum sum and return its sum.

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 3, -2, 5]

Output: 9

Explanation: Max subarray sum is 9 of elements (1, 2, 3, -2, 5) which is a contiguous subarray.

Input: arr[] = [-1, -2, -3, -4]

Output: -1

Explanation: Max subarray sum is -1 of element (-1)

Input: arr[] = [5, 4, 7]

Output: 16

Explanation: Max subarray sum is 16 of element (5, 4, 7)

Expected Time Complexity: O(n)

Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

Constraints:

1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 10^5

-10^7 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10^7
