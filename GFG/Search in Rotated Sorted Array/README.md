Given a sorted and rotated array arr[] of distinct elements, the task is to find the index of a target key. Return -1 if the key is not found.

Examples :

Input: arr[] = [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 1, 2, 3], key = 3

Output: 8

Explanation: 3 is found at index 8.

Input: arr[] = [3, 5, 1, 2], key = 6

Output: -1

Explanation: There is no element that has value 6.

Input: arr[] = [33, 42, 72, 99], key = 42

Output: 1

Explanation: 42 is found at index 1.


Constraints:

1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 10^6

0 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10^6

1 ≤ key ≤ 10^6
