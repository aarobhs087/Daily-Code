# Easy

Given a single linked list, calculate the sum of the last n nodes.

Note: It is guaranteed that n <= number of nodes.

Examples:

Input: Linked List: 5->9->6->3->4->10, n = 3

Output: 17

Explanation: The sum of the last three nodes in the linked list is 3 + 4 + 10 = 17.

Input: Linked List: 1->2, n = 2

Output: 3

Explanation: The sum of the last two nodes in the linked list is 2 + 1 = 3.


Constraints:

1 <= number of nodes, n <= 10^5

1 <= node->data <= 10^3
