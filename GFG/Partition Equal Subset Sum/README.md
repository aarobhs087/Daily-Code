Given an array arr[], determine if it can be partitioned into two subsets such that the sum of elements in both parts is the same.

Note: Each element must be in exactly one subset.

Examples:

Input: arr = [1, 5, 11, 5]

Output: true

Explanation: The two parts are [1, 5, 5] and [11].

Input: arr = [1, 3, 5]

Output: false

Explanation: This array can never be partitioned into two such parts.


Constraints:

1 ≤ arr.size ≤ 100

1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 200
