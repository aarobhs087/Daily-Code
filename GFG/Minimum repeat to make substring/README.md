Given two strings s1 and s2. Return a minimum number of times s1 has to be repeated such that s2 is a substring of it. If s2 can never be a substring then return -1.

Note: Both the strings contain only lowercase letters.

Examples:

Input: s1 = "ww", s2 = "www"

Output: 2

Explanation: Repeating s1 two times (wwww), s2 is a substring of it.

Input: s1 = "abcd", s2 = "cdabcdab" 

Output: 3 

Explanation: Repeating s1 three times (abcdabcdabcd), s2 is a substring of it. s2 is not a substring of s2 when it is repeated less than 3 times.

Input: s1 = "ab", s2 = "cab"

Output: -1

Explanation: No matter how many times we repeat s1, we can't get a string such that s2 is a substring of it.


Constraints:

1 ≤ |s1|, |s2| ≤ 10^5
