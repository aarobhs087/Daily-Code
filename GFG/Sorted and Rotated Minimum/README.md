# Easy

A sorted array arr[] (may contain duplicates) is rotated at some unknown point, the task is to find the minimum element in it. 

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [5, 6, 1, 2, 3, 4]

Output: 1

Explanation: 1 is the minimum element in the array.

Input: arr[] = [3, 2, 2, 2]

Output: 2

Explanation: Here 2 is the minimum element.

Input: arr[] = [4, 4, 4]

Output: 4

Explanation: Here 4 is the only minimum element.


Constraints:

1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 10^6

1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10^9
