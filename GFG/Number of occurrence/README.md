# Easy

Given a sorted array, arr[] and a number target, you need to find the number of occurrences of target in arr[]. 

Examples :

Input: arr[] = [1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3], target = 2

Output: 4

Explanation: target = 2 occurs 4 times in the given array so the output is 4.

Input: arr[] = [1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3], target = 4

Output: 0

Explanation: target = 4 is not present in the given array so the output is 0.

Input: arr[] = [8, 9, 10, 12, 12, 12], target = 12

Output: 3

Explanation: target = 12 occurs 3 times in the given array so the output is 3.


Constraints:

1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 10^6

1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10^6

1 ≤ target ≤ 10^6
