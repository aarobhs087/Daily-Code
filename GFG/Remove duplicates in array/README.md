# Easy

Given an array arr consisting of positive integers numbers, remove all duplicates numbers.

Example:

Input: arr[] = [2, 2, 3, 3, 7, 5] 

Output: [2, 3, 7, 5]

Explanation: After removing the duplicates 2 and 3 we get 2 3 7 5.

Input: arr[] = [2, 2, 5, 5, 7, 7] 

Output: [2, 5, 7]

Explanation: After removing the duplicates 2, 5 and 7 we get 2 5 7.


Expected Time Complexity: O(n)

Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

Constraints:

1<= arr.size() <=10^6

2<=arr[i]<=100
