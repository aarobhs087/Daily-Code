# Hard

Given an array arr[] and two integers say, x and y, find the number of sub-arrays in which the number of occurrences of x is equal to the number of occurrences of y.

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 1] , x= 1 , y = 2

Output: 2

Explanation: The possible sub-arrays have same equal number of occurrences of x and y are:

1) [1, 2], x and y have same occurrence(1).

2) [2, 1], x and y have same occurrence(1).

Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 1] , x = 4 , y = 6

Output: 6

Explanation: The possible sub-arrays have same equal number of occurrences of x and y are:

1) [1], x and y have same occurrence(0).

2) [2], x and y have same occurrence(0).

3) [1], x and y have same occurrence(0).

4) [1, 2], x and y have same occurrence(0).

5) [2, 1], x and y have same occurrence(0).

6) [1, 2, 1], x and y have same occurrence(0).

Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 1] , x= 1 , y = 4

Output: 1

Explanation: The possible sub-array have same equal number of occurrences of x and y is: [2], x and y have same occurrence(1)


Constraints: 

1 <= arr.size() <= 10^6

1 <= arr[i], x, y<=10^6
