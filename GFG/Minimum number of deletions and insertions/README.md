Given two strings str1 and str2. The task is to remove or insert the minimum number of characters from/in str1 so as to transform it into str2. It could be possible that the same character needs to be removed/deleted from one point of str1 and inserted to some another point.

Examples :

Input: str1 = "heap", str2 = "pea"

Output: 3

Explanation: 2 deletions and 1 insertion.

p and h deleted from heap. Then, p is inserted at the beginning. One thing to note, though p was required yet it was removed/deleted first from its position and then it is inserted to some other position. Thus, p contributes one to the deletion_count and one to the insertion_count.

Input : str1 = "geeksforgeeks", str2 = "geeks"

Output: 8

Explanation: 8 deletions, i.e. remove all characters of the string "forgeeks".

Expected Time Complexity: O(|str1|*|str2|)

Expected Space Complexity: O(|str1|*|str2|)

Constraints:

1 ≤ |str1|, |str2| ≤ 1000

All the characters are lowercase English alphabets
