# Easy

Given a square matrix mat[][] of size n x n. The task is to rotate it by 90 degrees in an anti-clockwise direction without using any extra space. 

Examples:

Input: mat[][] = 

[[1, 2, 3],

[4, 5, 6]
          
[7, 8, 9]]

Output: Rotated Matrix:

[3, 6, 9]

[2, 5, 8]

[1, 4, 7]

Input: mat[][] = 

[[1, 2],

[3, 4]]


Output: Rotated Matrix:

[2, 4]

[1, 3]


Constraints:

1 ≤ n ≤ 10^2

0 <= mat[i][j] <= 10^3
