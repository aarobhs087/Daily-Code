# Easy

Given an array arr[] of integers, the task is to count the number of ways to split given array elements into two disjoint groups such that the XOR of elements of each group is equal.

Note: The answer could be very large so print it by doing modulo with 109 + 7. 

Examples:

Input : arr[] = [1, 2, 3]

Output : 3

Explanation: {(1),(2, 3)}, {(2),(1, 3)}, {(3),(1, 2)} are three ways with equal XOR value of two groups.

Input : arr[] = [5, 2, 3, 2]

Output : 0

Explanation: No way to split into  two groups whose XOR is equal.


Expected Time Complexity: O(n).

Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1).


Constraints:

1<=arr.size()<=10^6

1<=arr[i]<=10^6
