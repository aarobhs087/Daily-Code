Given a strictly sorted 2D matrix mat[][] of size n x m and a number x. Find whether the number x is present in the matrix or not.

Note: In a strictly sorted matrix, each row is sorted in strictly increasing order, and the first element of the ith row (i!=0) is greater than the last element of the (i-1)th row.

Examples:

Input: mat[][] = [[1, 5, 9], [14, 20, 21], [30, 34, 43]], x = 14

Output: true

Explanation: 14 is present in the matrix, so output is true.

Input: mat[][] = [[1, 5, 9, 11], [14, 20, 21, 26], [30, 34, 43, 50]], x = 42

Output: false

Explanation: 42 is not present in the matrix.

Input: mat[][] = [[87, 96, 99], [101, 103, 111]], x = 101

Output: true

Explanation: 101 is present in the matrix.


Constraints:

1 <= n, m <= 1000

1 <= mat[i][j] <= 10^9

1 <= x <= 10^9
