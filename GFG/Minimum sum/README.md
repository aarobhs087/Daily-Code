Given an array arr[] such that each element is in the range [0 - 9], find the minimum possible sum of two numbers formed using the elements of the array. All digits in the given array must be used to form the two numbers. Return a string without leading zeroes.

Examples :

Input: arr[] = [6, 8, 4, 5, 2, 3]

Output: 604

Explanation: The minimum sum is formed by numbers 358 and 246.

Input: arr[] = [5, 3, 0, 7, 4]

Output: 82

Explanation: The minimum sum is formed by numbers 35 and 047.

Input: arr[] = [9, 4]

Output: 13

Explanation: The minimum sum is formed by numbers 9 and 4.


Constraints:

1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 10^6

0 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 9
