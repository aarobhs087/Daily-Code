You are given an array coins[], where each element represents a coin of a different denomination, and a target value sum. You have an unlimited supply of each coin type {coins1, coins2, ..., coinsm}.

Your task is to determine the minimum number of coins needed to obtain the target sum. If it is not possible to form the sum using the given coins, return -1.

Examples:

Input: coins[] = [25, 10, 5], sum = 30

Output: 2

Explanation: Minimum 2 coins needed, 25 and 5  

Input: coins[] = [9, 6, 5, 1], sum = 19

Output: 3

Explanation: 19 = 9 + 9 + 1

Input: coins[] = [5, 1], sum = 0

Output: 0

Explanation: For 0 sum, we do not need a coin

Input: coins[] = [4, 6, 2], sum = 5

Output: -1

Explanation: Not possible to make the given sum.
 
Constraints:

1 ≤ sum * coins.size() ≤ 10^6

0 <= sum <= 10^4

1 <= coins[i] <= 10^4

1 <= coins.size() <= 10^3
