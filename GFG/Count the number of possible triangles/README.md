Given an integer array arr[]. Find the number of triangles that can be formed with three different array elements as lengths of three sides of the triangle. 

A triangle with three given sides is only possible if sum of any two sides is always greater than the third side.

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [4, 6, 3, 7]

Output: 3

Explanation: There are three triangles possible [3, 4, 6], [4, 6, 7] and [3, 6, 7]. Note that [3, 4, 7] is not a possible triangle.  

Input: arr[] = [10, 21, 22, 100, 101, 200, 300]

Output: 6

Explanation: There can be 6 possible triangles: [10, 21, 22], [21, 100, 101], [22, 100, 101], [10, 100, 101], [100, 101, 200] and [101, 200, 300]

Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 3]

Output: 0

Explanation: No triangles are possible.

Constraints:

3 <= arr.size() <= 10^3

1 <= arr[i] <= 10^5
