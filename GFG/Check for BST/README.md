# Easy

Given the root of a binary tree. Check whether it is a BST or not.

Note: We are considering that BSTs can not contain duplicate Nodes.

A BST is defined as follows:

The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.

The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.

Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.

Examples:

Input: root = [2, 1, 3, N, N, N, 5]


Output: true 

Explanation: The left subtree of every node contains smaller keys and right subtree of every node contains greater keys. Hence, the tree is a BST.

Input: root = [2, N, 7, N, 6, N, 9] 



Output: false 

Explanation: Since the node to the right of node with key 7 has lesser key value, hence it is not a valid BST.

Input: root = [10, 5, 20, N, N, 9, 25]


Output: false

Explanation: The node with key 9 present in the right subtree has lesser key value than root node.


Constraints:

1 ≤ number of nodes ≤ 10^5

1 ≤ node->data ≤ 10^9
