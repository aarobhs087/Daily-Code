# Easy

Given a root of a binary tree with n nodes, the task is to find its level order traversal. Level order traversal of a tree is breadth-first traversal for the tree.

Examples:

Input: root[] = [1, 2, 3]


Output: [[1], [2, 3]]

Input: root[] = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]

Output: [[10], [20, 30], [40, 50]]

Input: root[] = [1, 3, 2, N, N, N, 4, 6, 5]

Output: [[1], [3, 2], [4], [6, 5]]


Constraints:

1 ≤ number of nodes ≤ 10^5

0 ≤ node->data ≤ 10^9
