Given n items, each with a specific weight and value, and a knapsack with a capacity of W, the task is to put the items in the knapsack such that the sum of weights of the items <= W and the sum of values associated with them is maximized. 

Note: You can either place an item entirely in the bag or leave it out entirely. Also, each item is available in single quantity.

Examples :

Input: W = 4, val[] = [1, 2, 3], wt[] = [4, 5, 1] 

Output: 3

Explanation: Choose the last item, which weighs 1 unit and has a value of 3.

Input: W = 3, val[] = [1, 2, 3], wt[] = [4, 5, 6] 

Output: 0

Explanation: Every item has a weight exceeding the knapsack's capacity (3).

Input: W = 5, val[] = [10, 40, 30, 50], wt[] = [5, 4, 2, 3] 

Output: 80

Explanation: Choose the third item (value 30, weight 2) and the last item (value 50, weight 3) for a total value of 80.


Constraints:

2 ≤ val.size() = wt.size() ≤ 10^3

1 ≤ W ≤ 10^3

1 ≤ val[i] ≤ 10^3

1 ≤ wt[i] ≤ 10^3
