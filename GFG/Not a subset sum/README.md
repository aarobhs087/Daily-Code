Given a sorted array arr[] of positive integers, find the smallest positive integer such that it cannot be represented as the sum of elements of any subset of the given array set.

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 3]

Output: 7

Explanation: 7 is the smallest positive number for which no subset is there with sum 7.

Input: arr[] = [3, 6, 9, 10, 20, 28]

Output: 1

Explanation: 1 is the smallest positive number for which no subset is there with sum 1.


Expected Time Complexity: O(n)

Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

Constraints

1 <= arr.size() <= 10^6

0 <= arr[i] <= 10^8
