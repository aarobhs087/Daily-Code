# Easy

Given a string s, composed of different combinations of '(' , ')', '{', '}', '[', ']', verify the validity of the arrangement.

An input string is valid if:

         1. Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.

         2. Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.

Examples :

Input: s = "[{()}]"

Output: true

Explanation: All the brackets are well-formed.

Input: s = "[()()]{}"

Output: true

Explanation: All the brackets are well-formed.

Input: s = "([]"

Output: False

Explanation: The expression is not balanced as there is a missing ')' at the end.

Input: s = "([{]})"

Output: False

Explanation: The expression is not balanced as there is a closing ']' before the closing '}'.


Constraints:

1 ≤ s.size() ≤ 10^6

s[i] ∈ {'{', '}', '(', ')', '[', ']'}
