# Easy

Given an array arr[] of positive integers. Find the number of pairs of integers whose difference equals a given number k.

Note: (a, b) and (b, a) are considered the same. Also, the same numbers at different indices are considered different.

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [1, 5, 3, 4, 2], k = 3

Output: 2

Explanation: There are 2 pairs with difference 3,the pairs are {1, 4} and {5, 2} 

Input: arr[] = [8, 12, 16, 4, 0, 20], k = 4

Output: 5

Explanation: There are 5 pairs with difference 4, the pairs are {0, 4}, {4, 8}, {8, 12}, {12, 16} and {16, 20}.


Constraints:

1 <= arr.size() <= 10^6

1 <= k <= 10^6
1 <= arri <= 106
