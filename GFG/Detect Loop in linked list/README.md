You are given the head of a singly linked list. Your task is to determine if the linked list contains a loop. A loop exists in a linked list if the next pointer of the last node points to any other node in the list (including itself), rather than being null.

Custom Input format:

A head of a singly linked list and a pos (1-based index) which denotes the position of the node to which the last node points to. If pos = 0, it means the last node points to null, indicating there is no loop.

Examples:

Input: head: 1 -> 3 -> 4, pos = 2

Output: true

Explanation: There exists a loop as last node is connected back to the second node.

Input: head: 1 -> 8 -> 3 -> 4, pos = 0

Output: false

Explanation: There exists no loop in given linked list.

Input: head: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4, pos = 1

Output: true

Explanation: There exists a loop as last node is connected back to the first node.


Constraints:

1 ≤ number of nodes ≤ 10^4

1 ≤ node->data ≤ 10^3       

0 ≤ pos ≤ Number of nodes in Linked List
