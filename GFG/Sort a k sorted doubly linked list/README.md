# Easy

Given a doubly linked list, each node is at most k-indices away from its target position. The problem is to sort the given doubly linked list. The distance can be assumed in either of the directions (left and right).

Examples :

Input: Doubly Linked List : 3 <-> 2 <-> 1 <-> 5 <-> 6 <-> 4 , k = 2

Output: 1 <-> 2 <-> 3 <-> 4 <-> 5 <-> 6

Explanation: After sorting the given 2-sorted list is 1 <-> 2 <-> 3 <-> 4 <-> 5 <-> 6.

Input: Doubly Linked List : 5 <-> 6 <-> 7 <-> 3 <-> 4 <-> 4 , k = 3

Output: 3 <-> 4 <-> 4 <-> 5 <-> 6 <-> 7

Explanation: After sorting the given 3-sorted list is 3 <-> 4 <-> 4 <-> 5 <-> 6 <-> 7.


Expected Time Complexity: O(n*logk)

Expected Auxiliary Space: O(k)


Constraints:

1 <= number of nodes <= 10^5

1 <= k < number of nodes

1 <= node->data <= 10^9
