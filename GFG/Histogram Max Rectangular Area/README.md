# Hard

You are given a histogram represented by an array arr, where each element of the array denotes the height of the bars in the histogram. All bars have the same width of 1 unit.

Your task is to find the largest rectangular area possible in the given histogram, where the rectangle can be formed using a number of contiguous bars.

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [60, 20, 50, 40, 10, 50, 60]

 Largest-Rectangular-Area-in-a-Histogram

Output: 100

Explanation: We get the maximum by picking bars highlighted above in green (50, and 60). The area is computed (smallest height) * (no. of the picked bars) = 50 * 2 = 100.

Input: arr[] = [3, 5, 1, 7, 5, 9]

Output: 15

Explanation:  We get the maximum by picking bars 7, 5 and 9. The area is computed (smallest height) * (no. of the picked bars) = 5 * 3 = 15.

Input: arr[] = [3]

Output: 3

Explanation: In this example the largest area would be 3 of height 3 and width 1.


Constraints:

1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 10^5

0 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10^4
