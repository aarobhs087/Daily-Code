# Easy

You are given two strings of equal lengths, s1 and s2. The task is to check if s2 is a rotated version of the string s1.

Note: The characters in the strings are in lowercase.

Examples :

Input: s1 = "abcd", s2 = "cdab"

Output: true

Explanation: After 2 right rotations, s1 will become equal to s2.

Input: s1 = "aab", s2 = "aba"

Output: true

Explanation: After 1 left rotation, s1 will become equal to s2.

Input: s1 = "abcd", s2 = "acbd"

Output: false

Explanation: Strings are not rotations of each other.


Constraints:

1 <= s1.size(), s2.size() <= 10^5
