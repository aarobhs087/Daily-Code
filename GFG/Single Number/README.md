# Easy

Given an array arr[] of positive integers where every element appears even times except for one. Find that number occurring an odd number of times.

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [1, 1, 2, 2, 2]

Output: 2

Explanation: In the given array all element appear two times except 2 which appears thrice.

Input: arr[] = [8, 8, 7, 7, 6, 6, 1]

Output: 1

Explanation: In the given array all element appear two times except 1 which appears once.

Expected Time Complexity: O(n)

Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

Constraints:

1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 10^6

0 ≤ arri ≤ 10^5
