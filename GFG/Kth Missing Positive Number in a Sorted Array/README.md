Given a sorted array of distinct positive integers arr[], we need to find the kth positive number that is missing from arr[].  

Examples :

Input: arr[] = [2, 3, 4, 7, 11], k = 5

Output: 9

Explanation: Missing are 1, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10… and 5th missing number is 9.

Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 3], k = 2

Output: 5

Explanation: Missing are 4, 5, 6… and 2nd missing number is 5.

Input: arr[] = [3, 5, 9, 10, 11, 12], k = 2

Output: 2

Explanation: Missing are 1, 2, 4, 5, 6… and 2nd missing number is 2.


Constraints:

1 <= arr.size() <= 10^5

1 <= k <= 10^5

1 <= arr[i]<= 10^6
