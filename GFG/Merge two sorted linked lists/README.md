Given the head of two sorted linked lists consisting of nodes respectively. The task is to merge both lists and return the head of the sorted merged list.

Examples:

Input: head1 = 5 -> 10 -> 15 -> 40, head2 = 2 -> 3 -> 20

Output: 2 -> 3 -> 5 -> 10 -> 15 -> 20 -> 40

Input: head1 = 1 -> 1, head2 = 2 -> 4

Output: 1 -> 1 -> 2 -> 4


Constraints:

1 <= no. of nodes<= 10^3

0 <= node->data <= 10^5
