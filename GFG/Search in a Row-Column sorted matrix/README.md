# Easy

Given a 2D integer matrix mat[][] of size n x m, where every row and column is sorted in increasing order and a number x, the task is to find whether element x is present in the matrix.

Examples:

Input: mat[][] = [[3, 30, 38],[20, 52, 54],[35, 60, 69]], x = 62

Output: false

Explanation: 62 is not present in the matrix, so output is false.

Input: mat[][] = [[18, 21, 27],[38, 55, 67]], x = 55

Output: true

Explanation: 55 is present in the matrix.

Input: mat[][] = [[1, 2, 3],[4, 5, 6],[7, 8, 9]], x = 3

Output: true

Explanation: 3 is present in the matrix.


Constraints:

1 <= n, m <=1000

1 <= mat[i][j] <= 10^9

1<= x <= 10^9
