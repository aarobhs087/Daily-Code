Given the head of two singly linked lists num1 and num2 representing two non-negative integers. The task is to return the head of the linked list representing the sum of these two numbers.

For example, num1 represented by the linked list : 1 -> 9 -> 0, similarly num2 represented by the linked list: 2 -> 5. Sum of these two numbers is represented by 2 -> 1 -> 5.

Note: There can be leading zeros in the input lists, but there should not be any leading zeros in the output list.

Examples:

Input: num1 = 4 - > 5, num2 = 3 -> 4 -> 5

Output:  3 -> 9 -> 0
 
Explanation: Given numbers are 45 and 345. There sum is 390.

Input: num1 = 0 -> 0 -> 6 -> 3, num2 = 0 -> 7 

Output: 7 -> 0 
 
Explanation: Given numbers are 63 and 7. There sum is 70.


Constraints:

1 <= size of both linked lists <= 10^6

0 <= elements of both linked lists <= 9
