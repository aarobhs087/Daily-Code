# Easy

Given an unsorted array arr and a number k which is smaller than size of the array. Find if the array contains duplicates within k distance.

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4] and k = 3

Output: false

Explanation: All duplicates are more than k distance away.

Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 3, 1, 4, 5] and k = 3

Output: true

Explanation: 1 is repeated at distance 3.


Constraints:

1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 10^6

1 ≤ k < arr.size()

1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10^5
