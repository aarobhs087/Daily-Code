Given two strings, one is a text string txt and the other is a pattern string pat. The task is to print the indexes of all the occurrences of the pattern string in the text string. Use 0-based indexing while returning the indices. 

Note: Return an empty list in case of no occurrences of pattern.

Examples :

Input: txt = "abcab", pat = "ab"

Output: [0, 3]

Explanation: The string "ab" occurs twice in txt, one starts at index 0 and the other at index 3. 

Input: txt = "abesdu", pat = "edu"

Output: []

Explanation: There's no substring "edu" present in txt.

Input: txt = "aabaacaadaabaaba", pat = "aaba"

Output: [0, 9, 12]


Constraints:

1 ≤ txt.size() ≤ 10^6

1 ≤ pat.size() < txt.size()

Both the strings consist of lowercase English alphabets.
