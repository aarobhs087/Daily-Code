Given q queries, You task is to implement the following four functions for a stack:

push(x) – Insert an integer x onto the stack.

pop() – Remove the top element from the stack.

peek() - Return the top element from the stack. If the stack is empty, return -1.

getMin() – Retrieve the minimum element from the stack in O(1) time. If the stack is empty, return -1.

Each query can be one of the following:

1 x : Push x onto the stack.

2 : Pop the top element from the stack.

3: Return the top element from the stack. If the stack is empty, return -1.

4: Return the minimum element from the stack.

Examples:

Input: q = 7, queries = [[1, 2], [1, 3], [3], [2], [4], [1, 1], [4]]

Output: [3, 2, 1]

Explanation: 

push(2): Stack is [2]

push(3): Stack is [2, 3]

peek(): Top element is 3

pop(): Removes 3, stack is [2]

getMin(): Minimum element is 2

push(1): Stack is [2, 1]

getMin(): Minimum element is 1

Input: q = 4, queries = [[1, 4], [1, 2], [4], [3]]

Output: [2, 2]

Explanation: 

push(4): Stack is [4]

push(2): Stack is [4, 2]

getMin(): Minimum element is 2

peek(): Top element is 2

Input: q = 5, queries = [[1, 10], [4], [1, 5], [4], [2]]

Output: [10, 5]

Explanation: 

push(10): Stack is [10]

getMin(): Minimum element is 10

push(5): Stack is [10, 5]

getMin(): Minimum element is 5

pop(): Removes 5, stack is [10]


Constraints:

1 <= q <= 10^5

0 <= values on the stack <= 10^9
