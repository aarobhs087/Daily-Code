# Hard

The n-queens puzzle is the problem of placing n queens on a (n×n) chessboard such that no two queens can attack each other. Given an integer n, find all distinct solutions to the n-queens puzzle. Each solution contains distinct board configurations of the n-queens placement, where the solutions are a permutation of [1,2,3..n] in increasing order, here the number in the ith place denotes that the ith-column queen is placed in the row with that number. For eg below figure represents a chessboard [3 1 4 2].

Examples:

Input: 1

Output: [1]

Explaination: Only one queen can be placed in the single cell available.

Input: 4

Output: [[2 4 1 3 ],[3 1 4 2 ]]

Explaination: These are the 2 possible solutions.


Expected Time Complexity: O(n!)

Expected Auxiliary Space: O(n2) 

Constraints: 1 ≤ n ≤ 10
