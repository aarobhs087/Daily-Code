# Easy

Given an array arr[] and an integer target. You have to find numbers of pairs in array arr[] which sums up to given target.

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [1, 5, 7, -1, 5], target = 6 

Output: 3

Explanation: Pairs with sum 6 are (1, 5), (7, -1) and (1, 5). 

Input: arr[] = [1, 1, 1, 1], target = 2 

Output: 6

Explanation: Pairs with sum 2 are (1, 1), (1, 1), (1, 1), (1, 1), (1, 1).

Input: arr[] = [10, 12, 10, 15, -1], target = 125

Output: 0


Constraints:

1 <= arr.size() <= 10^5

-10^4 <= arr[i] <= 10^4

1 <= target <= 10^4
