Given an unsorted array arr of of positive integers. One number 'A' from set {1, 2,....,n} is missing and one number 'B' occurs twice in array. Find numbers A and B.

Examples

Input: arr[] = [2, 2]

Output: 2 1

Explanation: Repeating number is 2 and smallest positive missing number is 1.

Input: arr[] = [1, 3, 3] 

Output: 3 2

Explanation: Repeating number is 3 and smallest positive missing number is 2.


Expected Time Complexity: O(n)

Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)


Constraints:

2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5

1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ n
