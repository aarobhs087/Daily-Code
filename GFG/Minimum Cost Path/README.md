# Hard

Given a square grid of size N, each cell of which contains an integer cost that represents a cost to traverse through that cell, we need to find a path from the top left cell to the bottom right cell by which the total cost incurred is minimum. From the cell (i,j) we can go (i,j-1), (i, j+1), (i-1, j), (i+1, j).  

Examples :

Input: grid = {{9,4,9,9},{6,7,6,4},{8,3,3,7},{7,4,9,10}}

Output: 43

Explanation: The grid is-

9 4 9 9

6 7 6 4

8 3 3 7

7 4 9 10

The minimum cost is-

9 + 4 + 7 + 3 + 3 + 7 + 10 = 43.

Input: grid = {{4,4},{3,7}}

Output: 14

Explanation: The grid is-

4 4

3 7

The minimum cost is- 4 + 3 + 7 = 14.

Expected Time Complexity: O((n^2)*log(n))

Expected Auxiliary Space: O(n^2) 
 Constraints:
1 ≤ n ≤ 500
1 ≤ cost of cells ≤ 500
