Given an integer array arr[]. You need to find and return the maximum sum possible from all the subarrays.

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [2, 3, -8, 7, -1, 2, 3]

Output: 11

Explanation: The subarray {7, -1, 2, 3} has the largest sum 11.

Input: arr[] = [-2, -4]

Output: -2

Explanation: The subarray {-2} has the largest sum -2.

Input: arr[] = [5, 4, 1, 7, 8]

Output: 25

Explanation: The subarray {5, 4, 1, 7, 8} has the largest sum 25.


Constraints:

1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 10^5

-10^9 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10^4
