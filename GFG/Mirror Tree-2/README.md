# Easy

Given a binary tree, convert the binary tree to its Mirror tree.

Mirror of a Binary Tree T is another Binary Tree M(T) with left and right children of all non-leaf nodes interchanged.     

Examples:

Input: root[] = [1, 2, 3, N, N, 4]

Output: [1, 3, 2, N, 4]

Explanation: 

In the inverted tree, every non-leaf node has its left and right child interchanged.

Input: root[] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

Output: [1, 3, 2, N, N, 5, 4]

Explanation:

In the inverted tree, every non-leaf node has its left and right child interchanged.


Constraints:

1 ≤ number of nodes ≤ 10^5

1 ≤ node->data ≤ 10^5
