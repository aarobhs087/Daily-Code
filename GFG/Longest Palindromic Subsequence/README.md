# Medium

Given a string s, return the length of the longest palindromic subsequence.

A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from the given sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

A palindromic sequence is a sequence that reads the same forward and backward.

Examples:

Input: s = "bbabcbcab"

Output: 7

Explanation: Subsequence "babcbab" is the longest subsequence which is also a palindrome.

Input: s = "abcd"

Output: 1

Explanation: "a", "b", "c" and "d" are palindromic and all have a length 1.

Input: s = "agbdba"

Output: 5

Explanation: The longest palindromic subsequence is "abdba", which has a length of 5. The characters in this subsequence are taken from the original string "agbdba", and they maintain the order of the string while forming a palindrome.


Constraints:

1 ≤ s.size() ≤ 1000

The string contains only lowercase letters.
