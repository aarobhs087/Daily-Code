Given an array arr[], where each element is at most k away from its target position, you need to sort the array optimally.

Note: DO NOT use direct library sort() function for this question.

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [6, 5, 3, 2, 8, 10, 9], k = 3

Output: [2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10]

Explanation: The sorted array will be 2 3 5 6 8 9 10

Input: arr[]= [1, 4, 5, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10], k = 2

Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

Explanation: The sorted array will be 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10


Constraints:

1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 10^6

1 ≤ k < arr.size()

1 ≤ arri ≤ 10^6
