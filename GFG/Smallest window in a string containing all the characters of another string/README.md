# Hard

Given two strings s and p. Find the smallest window in the string s consisting of all the characters(including duplicates) of the string p.  Return "-1" in case there is no such window present. In case there are multiple such windows of same length, return the one with the least starting index.

Note : All characters are in Lowercase alphabets. 

Examples:

Input: s = "timetopractice", p = "toc"

Output: toprac

Explanation: "toprac" is the smallest substring in which "toc" can be found.

Input: s = "zoomlazapzo", p = "oza"

Output: apzo

Explanation: "apzo" is the smallest substring in which "oza" can be found.


Expected Time Complexity: O(|s|)

Expected Auxiliary Space: O(n), n = len(p)

Constraints: 

1 ≤ |s|, |p| ≤ 10^5
