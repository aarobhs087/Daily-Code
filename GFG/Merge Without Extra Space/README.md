# Hard

Given two sorted arrays a[] and b[] of size n and m respectively, the task is to merge them in sorted order without using any extra space. Modify a so that it contains the first n elements and modify b so that it contains the last m elements.

Examples:

Input: a[] = [2, 4, 7, 10], b[] = [2, 3]

Output:

2 2 3 4

7 10

Explanation: After merging the two non-decreasing arrays, we get, 2 2 3 4 7 10

Input: a[] = [1, 5, 9, 10, 15, 20], b[] = [2, 3, 8, 13]

Output:

1 2 3 5 8 9

10 13 15 20

Explanation: After merging two sorted arrays we get 5 10 12 18 20.

Input: a[] = [0, 1], b[] = [2, 3]

Output:

0 1

2 3

Explanation: After merging two sorted arrays we get 0 1 2 3.


Constraints:

1 <= a.size(), b.size() <= 10^5

0 <= a[i], b[i] <= 10^7
