Given an array arr[] of non-negative integers. Find the length of the longest sub-sequence such that elements in the subsequence are consecutive integers, the consecutive numbers can be in any order.

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [2, 6, 1, 9, 4, 5, 3]

Output: 6

Explanation: The consecutive numbers here are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. These 6 numbers form the longest consecutive subsquence.

Input: arr[] = [1, 9, 3, 10, 4, 20, 2]

Output: 4

Explanation: 1, 2, 3, 4 is the longest consecutive subsequence.

Input: arr[] = [15, 13, 12, 14, 11, 10, 9]

Output: 7

Explanation: The longest consecutive subsequence is 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, which has a length of 7.


Constraints:

1 <= arr.size() <= 10^5

0 <= arr[i] <= 10^5
