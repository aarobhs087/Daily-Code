Given a grid of size n*m (n is the number of rows and m is the number of columns in the grid) consisting of '0's (Water) and '1's(Land). Find the number of islands.

Note: An island is either surrounded by water or the boundary of a grid and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically or diagonally i.e., in all 8 directions.

Examples:

Input: grid = [[0,1],[1,0],[1,1],[1,0]]

Output: 1

Explanation:

The grid is-

0 1

1 0

1 1

1 0

All lands are connected.


Input: grid = [[0,1,1,1,0,0,0],[0,0,1,1,0,1,0]]

Output: 2

Expanation:

The grid is-

0 1 1 1 0 0 0

0 0 1 1 0 2 0 

There are two islands in the grid. One island is marked by '1' and the other by '2'.


Expected Time Complexity: O(n*m)

Expected Space Complexity: O(n*m)

Constraints:

1 ≤ n, m ≤ 500

0 ≤ grid[i][j] ≤ 1Given a grid of size n*m (n is the number of rows and m is the number of columns in the grid) consisting of '0's (Water) and '1's(Land). Find the number of islands.
