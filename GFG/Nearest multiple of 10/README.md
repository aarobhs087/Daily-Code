# Easy

A string str is given to represent a positive number. The task is to round str to the nearest multiple of 10.  If you have two multiples equally apart from str, choose the smallest element among them.

Examples:

Input: str = 29 

Output: 30

Explanation: Close multiples are 20 and 30, and 30 is the nearest to 29. 

Input: str = 15

Output: 10

Explanation: 10 and 20 are equally distant multiples from 20. The smallest of the two is 10.


Expected Time Complexity: O(n).

Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1).

Constraints:

1 <= str.size()<= 10^5
