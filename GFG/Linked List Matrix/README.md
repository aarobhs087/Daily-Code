# Easy

Given a Matrix mat of n*n size. Your task is constructing a 2D linked list representation of the given matrix.

Input: mat = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]

Input: mat = [[23, 28], [23, 28]]


Expected Time Complexity: O(n2)

Expected Space Complexity: O(n2)

Constraints:

1 <= mat.size() <=15

1 <= mat[i][j] <=10^4
