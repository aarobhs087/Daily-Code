# Hard

Given a string str consisting of opening and closing parenthesis '(' and ')'. Find length of the longest valid parenthesis substring.
A parenthesis string is valid if: For every opening parenthesis, there is a closing parenthesis. Opening parenthesis must be closed in the correct order.

Examples :

Input: str = ((()

Output: 2

Explaination: The longest valid parenthesis substring is "()".

Input: str = )()())

Output: 4

Explaination: The longest valid parenthesis substring is "()()".


Expected Time Complexity: O(|str|)

Expected Auxiliary Space: O(|str|)

Constraints:

1 ≤ |str| ≤ 10^5
