Given a string s, your task is to find the longest palindromic substring within s.

A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string, defined as s[i...j] where 0 ≤ i ≤ j < len(s).

A palindrome is a string that reads the same forward and backward. More formally, s is a palindrome if reverse(s) == s.

Note: If there are multiple palindromic substrings with the same length, return the first occurrence of the longest palindromic substring from left to right.

Examples :

Input: s = “forgeeksskeegfor” 

Output: “geeksskeeg”

Explanation: There are several possible palindromic substrings like “kssk”, “ss”, “eeksskee” etc. But the substring “geeksskeeg” is the longest among all.

Input: s = “Geeks” 

Output: “ee”

Explanation: "ee" is the longest palindromic substring of "Geeks". 

Input: s = “abc” 

Output: “a”

Explanation: "a", "b" and "c" are longest palindromic substrings of same length. So, the first occurrence is returned.


Constraints:

1 ≤ s.size() ≤ 10^3

s consist of only lowercase English letters.
