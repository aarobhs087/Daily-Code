# Basic

Given an array arr of integers. Find whether three numbers are such that the sum of two elements equals the third element.

Example:

Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

Output: true

Explanation: The pair (1, 2) sums to 3.

Input: arr[] = [5, 3, 4]

Output: false

Explanation: No triplets satisfy the condition.


Expected Time Complexity: O(n^2)

Expected Auxilary Space: O(1)


Constraints:

1 <= arr.size() <= 10^3

0 <= arr[i] <= 10^5
